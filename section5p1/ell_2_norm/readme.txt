Y. Kanno: ``Structural reliability under uncertainty in moments: distributionally-robust reliability-based design optimization.'' Submitted to {\em Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics\/}.

The codes can run on Matlab ver.9.8 with SeDuMi ver.1.3 and CVX ver.2.2. Run "opt_design.m" to solve the optimization problems handled in section 5.1 of the article. Note that the results in the article was obtained with parameter values 
"param.num_data  = 1*10^(4)" and "param.num_data2 = 1*10^(6)" (this parameter setting is very time-consuming).
